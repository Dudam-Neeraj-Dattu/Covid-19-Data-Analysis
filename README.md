# Covid 19 Data Analysis Visualisation

- Tools used **PowerBI**

- Extracted Data from an API

- Done the transformation of data

- Visualisation is done that summarises **Confirmed, Death, Recovered, Active Cases.**

- Also calculates and displays **fatality rate** and **recovery rate**

- Since the API is not working, I have uploaded the data as excel format that contains country, confirmed, death and recovered cases

- The final report looks like the below image

- Used the concept of **tooltip** that shows data while hovering on the column in stack column visual
